Realising 4:2 Priority Encoder circuit using lookup table in FPGA:- In this project I have written RTL code for the given LUT and used systhesis in Vivado to observe the final circuit using the lookup table. Lookup table is first converted into a Boolean expression using min terms in k-map. Then this boolean expression is used to write the RTL/Verilog code. In this project I have synthesized the verilog code and added screenshots of the schematic diagrams observed in Vivado tool.
